`--xee`
: Strip expected error (ee) annotations from sequence headers when
  writing fasta or fastq files. Search for the pattern
  `[>@;]ee=float[;]`. Expected error annotations are added by the
  synonymous options `--fastq_eeout` and `--eeout` described in
  [`vsearch-fastx_filter(1)`](./commands/vsearch-fastx_filter.1.md).
