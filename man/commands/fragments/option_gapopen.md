: Set penalties for a gap opening. See
  [`vsearch-pairwise_alignment_parameters(7)`](./misc/vsearch-pairwise_alignment_parameters.7.md)
  for a complete description of the penalty declaration system. The
  default is to initialize the six gap extending penalties using a
  penalty of 20 for opening internal gaps and a penalty of 2 for
  opening terminal gaps, in both query and target sequences.
